**This repo contains several applications of ML algorithms to NASA's IRIS and SDO satellites.**
Here I provide a few toy examples of: 
- Grad-CAM to find the discriminant region between Sunspots and pores from SDO data.
- MINE-network for the calculation of mutule information between IRIS spectral lines
- t-SNE to find a two-dimensional embedding of solar spectra from an active and quiet Sun.

**Figure 1** â€” The convolutional neural network has learned to focus its attention on the penumbra (orange), since this is the determining factor that separates pores from Sunspots
